\description{
The AARP (original named the "American Association of Retired People"
but now just AARP) offers life insurance
to it's members. The data come from a full-page advertisement (circa 2012) in the "AARP
Bulletin", which has the second largest circulation in the world of any magazine, with
upward of 40 million subscribers. (Only the "AARP Magazine" has a larger circulation.)
}
\details{
Life insurance provides a "death benefit", money paid out to the insured person's survivors
upon death of the insured. There is a cost for the insurance. Among other factors, the cost
depends on both age and sex. (For this type of insurance, called "term insurance", the cost
changes as the insured person ages.)
