\title{Gene expression in cancer cells.}
\format{A data frame \code{NCI60_snippet} with 60 rows and 6000 variables.}
\usage{
data(NCI60_snippet)
}
\description{
The data come from a National Cancer Institute study of gene expression in cell lines
drawn from various sorts of cancer. Each row corresponds to a different cell line. The type
of cancer is identified by the first two or three letters of the row names, e.g. CO is colon, ME is melanoma, RE is kidney.
}
\details{
For each row, there are 6000 measurements of the gene expression as identified by activity on
a microarray probe. The variable names are the names of the probes.
