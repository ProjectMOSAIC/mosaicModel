\usage{
train(data, formula = formula(data), architecture = "lm")
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{the data to use for training}

\item{formula}{the formula describing the structure of the relationship among variables}

\item{architecture}{the model architecture, given as a function name, quoted or not, e.g. lm or "lm"}

This function coordinates four components in building statistical models:
1) the data to use for training
2) the response variable and
3) the explanatory variables, specified as a model formula
